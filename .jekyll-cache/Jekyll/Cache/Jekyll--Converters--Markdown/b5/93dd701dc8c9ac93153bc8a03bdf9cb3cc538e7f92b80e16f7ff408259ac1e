<p>I found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018">this dataset</a>
on flight delays for US domestic flights from 2009 to 2018. I decided to perform some visual
analysis using tableau. To accomplish this I needed to clean and query the dataset
as the dataset as is was quite large (6M+ rows for each year). To do this I used
SQL and pythonâ€™s pandas library.</p>

<h1 id="linear-regression"><a href="/posts/linreg.html">Linear Regression</a></h1>

<p>I decided to review some basic material on linear regression to refresh my interpretation and understanding of the model. First I go over what the model is (and how it differs from other types of models) and give an interpretation of what the actual equation and mathematics behind it represent. Then a derivation of the model in the univariate and multivariate case as well as an implementation in python using real datasets.</p>
